Our group identified a vehicle routing problem (VRP) for the shipping and receiving company UPS. Our goal is to identify the most effective routing for UPS delivery drivers within the Dallas locale

Introduction UPS is a leading global package delivery company that operates a vast fleet of vehicles to deliver packages to millions of customers every day. Optimizing routes for this fleet is a critical task that has a significant impact on the company's operations and bottom line. The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well-known optimization problem that involves finding the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers, considering factors such as distance, delivery time windows, and vehicle capacity constraints.

We used 12 Chipotle locations in the Dallas area to conveniently use the UPS fleet around the distribution center we chose.
